i had a session bug , which was due to multiple starting sessions.
i had empty input bug due to improper grabbing of data and spelling mistakes.
i had memory allocation bug which was due to improper calling of methods that retrives data from the database.

handling admin logic is still an issue.

had an issue when changing the status the new status didnot appear , it because of improper arrangement of parameter in the binding array that do not corresponds to  the placeholder.
